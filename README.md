# Text and Image Discord Bot
A Discord bot that connects to GPT-3 (default model: text-davinci-003) in context of the conversation. 

# Configuration in config.ini
```
[openai]
api_key = INSERT_API_KEY

[bot]
name = INSERT_BOT_NAME
model = text-davinci-003

[discord]
bot_token = INSERT_BOT_TOKEN
```

This bot by requires 'Administrator' privilges, which will be changed asap.

# Commands
To interact with the text bot, you don't require any commands, simply type and it will respond.

To call the image bot:
`/imagine {prompt}` 

Note that I have yet to actually make it into a Discord command, so the script just checks to see if '/imagine' is in the request and uses the rest of the message as a prompt.


# Python Requirements
discord
configparser
openai
requests


# Run
Run the bot with the following terminal command:
`python3 main.py`
